              RDF's Vision 2030 aims to create a sustainable future by
              integrating community-driven initiatives in education, healthcare,
              and economic development. By focusing on gender equality, resource
              allocation, and humanitarian aid, we strive to build a society
              where everyone has equal opportunities to thrive. Through a set of
              agreed goals based on SDGs, employing a theory of change derived
              from our years of experience, and proper utilization of resources,
              we will systematically move towards fulfilling this vision
              collectively.
